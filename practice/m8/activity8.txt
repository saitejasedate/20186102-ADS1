a = [9, 4, 8, 1, 6]

Selection sort:-				
i  	0	1	2	3	4

	9	4	8	1	4

0	1	4	8	9	6

1	1	4	8	9	6

2	1	4	6	9	8

3	1	4	6	8	9

no.of.comparisons = 10			
no.of.exchanges = 4				
							
Insertion sort:
i 	j	0	1	2	3	4

		9	4	8	1	6

1   0   9	4	8	1	6

2	1	4	9	8	1	6

3	1	4	8	9	1	6

4	1	4	8	1	9	6	

	1	4	1	8	9	6	

	1	1	4	8	9	6

5	1	1	4	8	6	9	

	1	1	4	6	8	9					

no.of.comparisons = 7
no.of.exchanges = 7

Selection sort it takes N*2/2 for comparisions and N exchanges.
Insertion sort takes N*2/4 comparisions and N*2/4 exchanges.
So, insertion method is faster than selection sort method.
